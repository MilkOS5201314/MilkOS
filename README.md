MilkOS project source code and image files

MilkOS is a minimalist Linux system developed based on the original Linux kernel
using the latest version of the Linux kernel and openjdk by default
designed for Minecraft Java Server
the system itself takes up about 50MB of memory when running
leaving a lot more memory for the server
this system also removes almost all useless software
which can bring a higher performance improvement
